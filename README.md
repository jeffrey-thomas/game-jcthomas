# Overview
In this game, the player is represented by a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen. The player controls the spaceships left-right movement by moving the mouse and can fire projectiles upwards towards enemies by clicking. Enemies will be moving above the player firing their own projectiles downwards. If the player destroys all of the enemies they can move on the next wave. If the player is hit by an enemy projectile it is game over. 

The goal of this project was to learn how to make an interactive web application.
